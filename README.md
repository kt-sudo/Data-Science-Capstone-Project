# 🚀 SpaceY Falcon 9 Launch Prediction Project

## 📌 Overview
The **commercial space age** is here! Private space companies are making space travel more affordable and accessible than ever before. Giants like **Virgin Galactic**, **Rocket Lab**, **Blue Origin**, and especially **SpaceX** are driving innovation in orbital and suborbital missions.

Among them, **SpaceX** has achieved remarkable milestones:
- Sending spacecraft to the **International Space Station (ISS)**  
- Launching **Starlink**, a satellite internet constellation  
- Conducting **manned space missions**  
- Reducing launch costs significantly by **reusing Falcon 9’s first stage**

💰 SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 launches at **$62 million**, while competitors charge upwards of **$165 million**. Much of this cost advantage comes from **first-stage reusability**.

## 🎯 Project Scenario
Imagine you are a **data scientist at SpaceY**, a new competitor founded by billionaire industrialist *Allon Musk*. Your mission is to:
1. **Predict Falcon 9 First-Stage Reusability**  
   - Will the first stage land successfully?  
   - This determines if a rocket can be reused and thus directly affects launch costs.  

2. **Estimate Launch Costs**  
   - Build dashboards and predictive models to determine launch pricing.  

3. **Analyze Mission Data**  
   - Explore public datasets on SpaceX launches.  
   - Identify factors influencing first-stage recovery: payload, orbit, customer, mission type, etc.  

Instead of rocket science equations, you’ll leverage **data science and machine learning** to make predictions.

## 🛰️ Why Falcon 9 First Stage Matters
- The **first stage** is the largest, most expensive part of the rocket.  
- Unlike other providers, **SpaceX reuses** the first stage to save costs.  
- Outcomes vary:
  - ✅ Successful landing → Rocket reused → Lower cost  
  - ❌ Crash or sacrifice due to mission constraints → Rocket lost → Higher cost  

---

## 🔧 Project Goals
- Gather and clean **SpaceX launch data**  
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**  
- Build **interactive dashboards** for insights  
- Develop and evaluate **machine learning models** to predict:
  - First-stage landing success  
  - Launch cost estimates  

---

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)  
- **SQL** for data querying  
- **Dash / Flask** for dashboards  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for development & experimentation  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, etc.
